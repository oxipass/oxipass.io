#### **Overview**

OxiPass is a password manager that allows you to securely store offline your
sensitive information (like passwords, credit cards, pin codes, blockchain wallet passphrases, etc).
Privacy is our highest priority, that's why this app is fully offline solution. Your
information stored only in your local computer or smartphone, not any bit of information is transferred
to any server or cloud service. Moreover, 
your data is encrypted with AES-256 or any other algorithm supported by 
the library OxiCrypt and protected against physical attacks
as there is no server or cloud to hack your data.

#### **Features**

- Strong security with multiple encryption algorithms
- Offline local storage
- Flexible customizable data structure
- No servers or cloud services, no data transmission
- No ads or analytics
- No registration required
- Adjustable user interface
- Reliable automatic local backups

#### **Goal**

The main purpose is simply to provide the best password manager. It should be an open source,
privacy-preserving, easy to use, secure, flexible, customizable, fast and 
compatible with all popular platforms.

#### **Technical overview**

The main library is written in Go and uses SQLite as a local database. All the data is encrypted 
with the algorithm of your choice (implemented by [oxicrypt](https://github.com/oxipass/oxicrypt) ) 
and easily compilable for any platform. The library is a core of the solution, it is planned
to use it in mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop (Mac/Windows/Linux) applications.

#### **The solution repository**

We started developing this password manager as an open source project from the very beginning, 
check out our GitHub repository: 
[github.com/oxipass](https://github.com/oxipass)

#### **Advantages compared to other password managers**

We are going to provide the password manager that has the highest level of security and privacy.
Here is why our app will beat most other password managers:

- flexible customizable data structure and user interface (custom items and fields)
- simple technical solution with a single library with no dependencies (except SQLite)
- open source project, anybody can contribute, check the code or use in your own projects
- no registration required, no server or cloud service is used to store the data
- support for any encryption algorithm implemented by [oxicrypt](https://github.com/oxipass/oxicrypt)
- no ads, no analytics, no statistics collection

#### **Support the project**

We are working hard to provide the best ever password manager. If you like the project and want to help,
